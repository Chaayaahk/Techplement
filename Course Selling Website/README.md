# EduLearn - Online Course Selling Website

## Overview

EduLearn is a user-friendly online platform designed to help users buy and sell courses to enhance their skills. The website features a clean and modern design, making it easy for users to explore various courses, and includes authentication features for login and signup.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files:

- `index.html`: The main landing page for the website. It includes sections for the header, hero section, courses, about us, contact form, and footer.

- `login.html`: The login page for users to access their accounts.

- `signup.html`: The signup page for new users to create an account.

- `style.css`: The stylesheet containing all the styles for the website, including global styles, header and navigation, hero section, courses section, forms, and footer.

- `script.js`: A JavaScript file that handles the contact form submission, displaying an alert upon submission, and clearing the form.

## Features

- **Header Navigation**: Contains links to different sections of the website (Home, Courses, About, Contact) and authentication buttons for Login and Signup.
- **Hero Section**: Features a welcome message and a call-to-action button to explore courses.
- **Courses Section**: Displays a grid of courses with images, descriptions, and an 'Enroll Now' button.
- **About Section**: Provides information about EduLearn's mission and services.
- **Contact Section**: Includes a form for users to send messages.
- **Footer**: Contains information about EduLearn, quick links, and contact details.

## Styling

The website uses a modern and responsive design with a focus on user experience. Key styles include:
- A dark header with a yellow accent.
- A hero section with a background image and central text.
- Course cards with hover effects for better interactivity.
- Forms styled for a clean and user-friendly appearance.

## JavaScript Functionality

The `script.js` file includes a simple JavaScript function to handle form submissions in the contact section. When the form is submitted, it prevents the default form action, displays an alert with the user's information, and then resets the form.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the website.
3. Ensure that the `images` directory and any required backend files (e.g., `login-handler.php` and `signup-handler.php`) are properly set up for full functionality.
